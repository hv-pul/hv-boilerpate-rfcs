# hv-boilerpate RFCs

## Overview

[See all RFCs here](https://github.com/hv-pul/hv-boilerpate-rfcs/issues)

## What is an RFC?

"RFC" stands for **request for comments**. The idea is to enable low-barrier discussions of new features or larger changes to the [hv-boilerplate](https://bitbucket.org/hinderlingvolkart/hv-boilerplate).

You can use this for quick collections of ideas, documenting features or bugfixes that you have already merge etc â€¦

## Why do we need these?

The boilerplate has been around for a while and has involved numerous times. It has seen significant improvements in that time (mainly thanks to `@SK`). But we could always push for more, so it would be great to hear from everyone that is using the boilerplate regularly where they see room to grow.

Hopefully, this will make also make the boilerplate less intimidating to new team members and serve as a bit of implicit documentation.

## How to

To make things as low-barrier as possbile, all you need to do is create an issue [here](https://github.com/hv-pul/hv-boilerpate-rfcs/issues).
