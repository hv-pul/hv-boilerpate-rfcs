# Summary

Brief explanation of the feature/issue.

# Basic example

If it makes sense, include a basic code example.

# Motivation

Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What is the expected outcome? 
Please give a short explanation so we could discuss if there are existing or alternative solutions.

# Detailed design

If you already have an idea for how the feature should work or the issue should be solved, please explain in detail here.

# Drawbacks

What are reasons why we should *not* do this? Even if it is a good idea, please consider:
- implementation cost, both in term of code size and complexity
- whether the proposed feature should be implemented in specific projects instead of the boilerplate
- integration of this feature with other existing and planned features
- cost of migrating existing projects using the boilerplate (is it a breaking change?)

# Alternatives

What other designs have been considered? What is the impact of not doing this?

# Adoption strategy

How would we integrate this into the boilerplate? Would it work with existing projects?

# Unresolved questions

What are you unsure about? What parts of the design are still undecided?
